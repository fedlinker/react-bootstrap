The components developed path is `/src/components`.

All the components are built with these dependencies below:

- `@emotion/core`: **css-in-js** library.
- `theme-ui`: support theme function with emotion.
- `polished`: color transformer.
- `@fedlinker/font-awesome`: react components of font-awesome icons.

### Documentations

- Documents are built with `docz`.
- This project uses the custom components in `/src/gatsby-theme-docz`.

if you want to add document for your component, add `docs` folder in your component directory and add `.mdx` file in this folder.
